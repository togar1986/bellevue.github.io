								practice how to save water, clean the environment, recycle, plant trees, gardening, and raise school pets such as goats and chickens.</p>
							<p>The School also is the  first Smart-Tech School in West Africa. Thus, we aim to not only introduce our students to all the latest technology available,
								but to make sure the hands-on experiences are available for them. This is the reason of the school introducing the INTERACTIVE SMART BOARD to be as one of the technology
								device available for the teachers to use as part of their teaching tools. This methods will also encourage instant 2 ways learning between the teacher and students in the class,
								because the Interactive Smart Board will make the learning process to be more fun and not only from books to blackboard.</p>

						    <p>
									 our vision is to groom our students who are the future of global generation through curriculum that is balance. Balance here means, they will learn from the text books, from nature
									 and from all the charity works to the communities. This will teach them how to behave, and to contribute as citizens of the country, and global world as whole.
								 </p>

								 <p>Guided by this vision, our mission is to make sure that the school will not only be a place where students will learn and gain their educations but also to be one big family, where
									 our students will love fellow students as their own siblings, and respect teachers as their parents, and the school as their home, and the community around them as their relatives.
								 </p>

								 <p>
                   With this mission, we hope that not only the students will feel love for this school, but also parents and the community will come together to e part of this school. We wish to have full
									 participations and supports from the parents of our children to get involve with every school activities. We hope that community around the school will accept the school and our beloved students
									 as part of them, and have love and care for the school.

				 <!-- <h4>ARE YOU READY ?</h4> -->
				  <p>
					 Just like home, our kids leave their shoes at the door. They run sock- or bare-footed
                     in our classrooms. Caring for the school houseplants before class starts is our
                    daily ritual.Gardening, cooking and art are on equal footing with our math and science curricular.In short, we make our school homely and education a joy.
